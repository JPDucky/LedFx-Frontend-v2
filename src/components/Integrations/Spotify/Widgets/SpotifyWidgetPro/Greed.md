                @Spotify:

                behind premium, r u serious?? For REAL? o.k. business 101:`}

                Give 1 Dev Premium for free -> Get XXXX new paying customers

                2nd Tip:
                Instead of blocking access completely,
                you might want to give them devs limited access, like:
                - you can only access 10 Songs (should be enough even to test shuffle)
                - you can only access XX minutes without interruption 
                  (interruption could be x minutes no access, or even ads)

                Now im saying:
                Where is my lifetime-premium?`} */}
